# Turtle Mountain History Reservation Export
Export of Turtle Mountain History pages from historical archives

This repository is a set of scripts that resulted in an export of the Turtle Mountain Reservation history.
The book is stored at [St. Ann's Centennial: 100 years of Faith, Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation](http://www.digitalhorizonsonline.org/digital/collection/ndsl-books/id/28098)

The data was public, so for the sake of preserving family history, I've exported the data for posterity and sharing.

The data has been archived in a zip, but the scripts will allow a fresh export, and an export of generally anything at digital horizons until measures are taken to lock down the api.
